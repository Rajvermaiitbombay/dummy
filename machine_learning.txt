from sklearn import preprocessing
# split the dataset into training nd testing datasets
train/test split
k-fold cross-validation **
find the accuracy of the model, MSE(mean squared eror)
# accuracy of classifier=1. jaccard index (j=|y intersection y1|/|y|+|y1|-|y intersec y1|),
2. F1-score (confusion matrix),3. Log loss.
# decision trees
use entropy or information gain to find best split.
repeat this process untill pure sunsets will be found
# Support vector machine ( SVM )
Kernels=linear,polynomial, radial basis function(RBF), sigmoid, Gaussian.
kernels will help us to convert the data from non-linearly inseparable to linearly separable.
we choose that hyperplane which has highest margin from support vectors.
we use gradient descent method to find best intercept and angle of hyper plane so that it has highest margin.
image recognition, spam detection, sentiment analysis, outlier detection= SVM will be used.
# clustering 
--k-means clustering
use elbow method to maximize the accuracy
--Hierarchical clustering
1. Agglomerative 2. Divisive clustering
# Recommender system
1. content-based (simillar to other product ) 
2. collaborative filtering (simillar to other users which have same taste)
--Implementing recommender system types
1. memory based
uses the entire user-item dataset to generate a reco system
uses pearson correlation,euclidean dist..
2. model based
uses ML techniques like regression,clustering,classification
